# This __package_dpkg type does not check whether a *.deb package is
# allready installed. It just copies the *.deb package over to the
# destination and installs it. We could use __package_apt to check
# whether a *.deb package is allready installed and only install it
# if we're given a --force argument or similar (would be clever not
# to conflict with dpkg's --force options). But currently we don't
# do any checks or --force'ing.
