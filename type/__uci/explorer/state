# This explorer retrieves the current state of the configuration option
# The output of this explorer is one of these values:
#   present
#     The configuration option is present and has the value of the
#     parameter --value.
#   absent
#     The configuration option is not defined.
#   different
#     The configuration option is present but has a different value than the
#     parameter --value.
#   rearranged
#     The configuration option is present (a list) and has the same values as
#     the parameter --value, but in a different order.

# NOTE: older releases of OpenWrt do not include sbin in PATH but uci(1) is
#       installed in /sbin.
